# Contribution Standards
Note: Currently, we do not accept contributions from third parties,
unless specifically stated.

This list of contribution standards will grow over time; please keep
up to date with this list.

## Branch Naming
Unless there is good reason to do otherwise, branches should be prefixed
with the username of the individual specifically leading the changes
made in the branch.

For example, given a branch working on implementing turning the button blue,
follow the format:

```wtpisaac/turning-button-blue```

replacing the username with your own, and the feature name with your own.
